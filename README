Alien - Pure Lua extensions
===========================

For more information, see http://mascarenhas.github.com/alien.


What is Alien?
--------------

Alien is a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for Lua. An FFI lets you
call functions in dynamic libraries (.so, .dylib, .dll, etc.) from Lua
code without having to write, compile and link a C binding from the
library to Lua. In other words, it lets you write extensions that call
native code using just Lua.

Alien works on Unix-based systems and Windows. It has been tested on
Linux/x86, Linux/x64, Linux/ARM, FreeBSD/x86, Windows/x86, OS X/x86,
and OS X/PPC.

The Windows binary uses MSVCR80.DLL for compatibility with LuaBinaries.

Installing Alien
----------------

The best way to install Alien is through
[LuaRocks](http://luarocks.org): just do `luarocks install alien`.

Alien uses the GNU build system. For detailed instructions, see
INSTALL. For a quick start:

[If using git sources:

  ./bootstrap
]

  ./configure && make [&& make install]

You may need to supply non-default paths (e.g. if you are using a
system that supports more than one version of Lua):

For example, on Debian or Ubuntu:

  CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/include/lua5.1' ./configure --libdir=/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1 --datadir=/usr/local/share/lua/5.1 --with-lua-suffix=5.1

To run some tests:

  make check

Credits
-------

Alien is designed and implemented by Fabio Mascarenhas. It uses the
great [libffi](http://sourceware.org/libffi)
library by Anthony Green (and others) to do the heavy lifting of calling
to and from C. The name was stolen from Common Lisp FFIs.

License
-------

Alien uses the MIT license (the same as Lua).
